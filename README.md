This project visualizes long-term demographic differences in motor vehicle death rates for non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the US from 1934-2014. A similar graph was published in Monica King's dissertation: https://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/2396/
 
Data source: 1934-1998 came from https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_historical_data.htm; 1999-2014 came from CDC WONDER

Monica King cleaned, wrangled, and aggregated the data.
