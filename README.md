Demographic differences in motor vehicle death rates

Description
------
This project visualizes long-term demographic differences in motor vehicle death rates for non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the US from 1934-2014. A similar graph was published in Monica King's dissertation: https://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/2396/
 
Data source: 1934-1998 data came from the CDC HIST290 tables (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/hist290.htm); 1999-2014 data were queried from CDC WONDER

Monica King cleaned, wrangled, and aggregated the data.
